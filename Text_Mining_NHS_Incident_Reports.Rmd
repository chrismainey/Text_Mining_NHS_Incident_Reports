# Patient Safety and Incident Reporting

+ Prevention of errors and adverse effects to patients associated with health care (WHO description).

+ Increasingly prominent in NHS, after 'An Organisation with memory' __(Donaldson, 2000)__

--

.pull-left[
+ Incident reporting is seen as a pillar of this:
 + Based on other industries
 + Not implemented in same way __(Macrae, 2015)__
 + Should be a cue for further investigation
 + 'Tip of the iceberg'
 + Incidents  represent multiple failures of systems

## The National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS)

_Incidents:_

“Any unintended event caused by the health care that either did or could have led to patient harm” 

--

+ Local incident reporting systems, e.g. Datix

--

+ Mapped and submitted to national system (NRLS)

--

+ Examples of learning:
 + Risks in airway management between critical care and other settings (McGrath and Thomas, 2011)
 + Drug-related errors are commonly about wrong administration (Cousins et al., 2012) (Franklin et al., 2014)),
 + Risks of shock and death using bone cement for fractured neck of femur surgery (Rutter et al., 2014) 
 
--

+ Major problems with data, including completeness, anonymisation, quality of reports etc.



---

# How is it used?

+ Quarterly and monthly figures
 + Counts
 + Is high number of reports good or bad?
 + Different size organisations?
 + Major part of my work was developing risk adjustment methods for this
 
--

+ Manual reading of incident reports:
 + Trained clinical reviewrs
 + Qualitative methods

---

## See the problem?

--

+ Real signal is in free-text

--

+ Regulator is only able to review 0.5%, representing severe harm or death

--

__“The number of reports received is … huge, so that raises the question of how can we analyse them all properly. Decisions therefore need to be made as to whether we need tighter rules on incident reporting, and the distinction between local and national level reporting and follow-through’__  ___Prof. Donaldson, (Francis, 2013).___

## What if we can use text mining methods to help?

# Previous work

# My work

Used the `tidytext` package (Silge Robinson,)
