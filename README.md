# Text Mining NHS Incident Reporting Data

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repo is my talk and examples for BirminghamR Apr-2020.

It discusses my PhD work on analysing the NHS national incident
reporting data, specifically the section on text mining.

We will look at some of the concepts of the `tidytext` package by Julia
Silge and David Robinson, and use one of Julia’s examples, adapted from
<https://github.com/juliasilge/sherlock-holmes> , to give us an idea of
how it works.
