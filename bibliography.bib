	title = {Discovering {New} {Kinds} of {Patient} {Safety} {Incidents}},
	abstract = {Every year, large numbers of patients in National Health Service (NHS) care suffer because of a patient safety incident. The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) collects large amounts of data describing individual incidents. As well as being described by categorical and numerical variables, each incident is described using free text. The aim of the work was to find quite small groups of similar incidents, which were of types that were previously unknown to the NPSA. A model of the text was produced, such that the position of each incident reflected its meaning to the greatest extent possible. The basic model was the vector space model. Dimensionality reduction was carried out in two stages: unsupervised dimensionality reduction was carried out using principal component analysis, and supervised dimensionality reduction using linear discriminant analysis. It was then possible to look for groups of incidents that were more tightly packed than would be expected given the overall distribution of the incidents. The process for assessing these groups had three stages. Firstly, a quantitative measure was used, allowing a large number of parameter combinations to be examined. The groups found for an ‘optimum’ parameter combination were then divided into categories using a qualitative filtering method. Finally, clinical experts assessed the groups qualitatively.
 The transition probabilities model was also examined: this model was based on the empirical probabilities that two word sequences were seen in the text. An alternative method for dimensionality reduction was to use information about the subjective meaning of a small sample of incidents elicited from experts, producing a mapping between high and low dimensional models of the text. The analysis also included the direct use of the categorical variables to model the incidents, and empirical analysis of the behaviour of high dimensional spaces.},

	abstract = {The issue of patient safety is an extremely important one; each year in the UK, hundreds of thousands of people suffer due to some sort of incident that occurs whilst they are in National Health Service care. The National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) works to try to reduce the scale of the problem. One of its major projects is to collect a very large dataset, the Reporting and Learning System (RLS), which describes several million of these incidents. The RLS is used as the basis for research by the NPSA. However, the NPSA has identified a gap in their work between high-level quantitative analysis and detailed, manual analysis of small samples. This paper describes the lessons learned from a knowledge discovery process that attempted to fill this gap. The RLS contains a free text description of each incident. A high dimensional model of the text is calculated, using the vector space model with term weighting applied. Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to produce the final models of the text. These models are examined using an anomaly detection tool to find groups of incidents that should be coherent in meaning, and that might be of interest to the NPSA. A three stage process is developed for assessing the results. The first stage uses a quantitative measure based on the use of planted groups of known interest, the second stage involves manual filtering by a non-expert, and the third stage is assessment by clinical experts.},

	abstract = {Patient safety has been an under-recognised and under-researched concept until recently. It is now high on the healthcare quality agenda in many countries of the world including the UK. The recognition that human error is inevitable in a highly complex and technical field like medicine is a first step in promoting greater awareness of the importance of systems failure in the causation of accidents. Plane crashes are not usually caused by pilot error per se but by an amalgam of technical, environmental, organisational, social and communication factors which predispose to human error or worsen its consequences. In healthcare, the systematic investigation of error in the administration of medication will often reveal similarly complex causation. Experience and research from other sectors, in particular the airline industry, show that the impact of human error can be reduced if the necessary work is put in to detect and then remove weaknesses and vulnerabilties in the system. The NHS is putting in place a comprehensive programme to learn more effectively from adverse events and near misses. This aims to reduce the burden of the estimated 850,000 adverse events which occur in hospitals each year as well as targeting high risk areas such as medication error.},

To be useful, a classifier must appreciably outperform a trivial solution, such as choosing the majority class. Any application that is inherently noisy limits the error rate, and cost, that is achievable. When data are normally distributed, even a Bayes optimal classifier has a vanishingly small reduction in the majority classifier’s error rate, and cost, as imbalance increases. For fat tailed distributions, and when practical classifiers are used, often no reduction is achieved.},

	abstract = {Learning from patient safety incident reports is a vital part of improving healthcare. However, the volume of reports and their largely free-text nature poses a major analytic challenge. The objective of this study was to test the capability of autonomous classifying of free text within patient safety incident reports to determine incident type and the severity of harm outcome. Primary care patient safety incident reports (n=31333) previously expert-categorised by clinicians (training data) were processed using J48, SVM and Naïve Bayes.The SVM classifier was the highest scoring classifier for incident type (AUROC, 0.891) and severity of harm (AUROC, 0.708). Incident reports containing deaths were most easily classified, correctly identifying 72.82\% of reports. In conclusion, supervised ML can be used to classify patient safety incident report categories. The severity classifier, whilst not accurate enough to replace manual processing, could provide a valuable screening tool for this critical aspect of patient safety.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a routine incident reporting system in identifying patient safety incidents. DESIGN: Two stage retrospective review of patients' case notes and analysis of data submitted to the routine incident reporting system on the same patients. SETTING: A large NHS hospital in England. POPULATION: 1006 hospital admissions between January and May 2004: surgery (n=311), general medicine (n=251), elderly care (n=184), orthopaedics (n=131), urology (n=61), and three other specialties (n=68). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of admissions with at least one patient safety incident; proportion and type of patient safety incidents missed by routine incident reporting and case note review methods. RESULTS: 324 patient safety incidents were identified in 230/1006 admissions (22.9\%; 95\% confidence interval 20.3\% to 25.5\%). 270 (83\%) patient safety incidents were identified by case note review only, 21 (7\%) by the routine reporting system only, and 33 (10\%) by both methods. 110 admissions (10.9\%; 9.0\% to 12.8\%) had at least one patient safety incident resulting in patient harm, all of which were detected by the case note review and six (5\%) by the reporting system. CONCLUSION: The routine incident reporting system may be poor at identifying patient safety incidents, particularly those resulting in harm. Structured case note review may have a useful role in surveillance of routine incident reporting and associated quality improvement programmes.},
