# Text Mining NHS Incident Reporting Data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repo is my talk and examples for BirminghamR Apr-2020.

It discusses my PhD work on analysing the NHS national incident reporting data, specifically the section on text mining.

We will look at some of the concepts of the `tidytext` package by Julia Silge and David Robinson, and use one of Julia's examples, adapted from https://github.com/juliasilge/sherlock-holmes , to give us an idea of how it works.
